        <p class="explanationsExceed"> This visualization breaks down the population of Canadian residents, focusing on the indigenous population. According to the plot, First Nations is the largest Indigenous group in Canada.

        </ul>

        <p class="explanationsExceed"> Between populations, I notice that for both sexes, Non-Indigenous people report lower percentages of fair or poor mental health while indigenous groups report higher. Particularly, it seems that the First Nations group reports the highest percentage of poor or fair mental health while the Metis group falls somewhere in between Non-Indigenous and First Nations.

        <p class="explanationsExceed"> The largest population for the First Nations group is located in Ontario with 332,555 individuals. However, Quebec is a close second, within 50,000 of this number. Both of these locations are in the Southeast area of Canada. The largest population of the Inuit group is located in Nunavut with 30,8555 individuals. This area is located in the Northeast part of Canada. Finally, the largest population of Metis individuals is in Ontario. There are 131,775 individuals in this group located in the Southeast area of Canada. </p>

        <h2 id = "exceedTitle"> This project analyzed Indigenous Populations in Canada with a particular focus on mental health, food insecuirty, and regional differences. </h2>

        <p class="explanationsExceed"> Overall trends revealed that the largest indigenous population is the First Nations Group, making up almost 4% of the Canadian population. The second plot reveals that females report worse mental health on average, especially those in the First Nations Group. Finally, the last map reveals there are higher percentages of Indigenous Individuals in the Northern territories.
        This was my first experience using plotly, folium, CSS, and HTML. There are definitely errors but overall I am proud of my ability to construct a webpage displaying a range of information.
