#DATA 201 Interacting with Data Webpage

This project was made in my Data Visualization class (Data 201) during my Junior year (Fall 2023). 

This specific project combines several visualizations made using the plotly library. HTML and CSS code, written by me, combines these visualizations to create a webpage displaying the final results. The link can be found here: https://cefrida.github.io/data_interact/
